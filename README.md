Storybot is an AI assisted text editor for writing stories divided into chapters. 
Easily write stories with Storybot and its simple and accessible tools. AI can help to easily write anything you could ever think of. The options take your story from just a plain text document to a quick draft of your story to an extensive multichapter story with dialogues between characters.

## **Installation**
Download the source code and build it on your own.

## **Features**
Storybot features:
* Build your characters
* Settings which are similar to Windows 11 settings
* Menus like Save, Export 
* Focus Mode – focus on things that really matter
* Read aloud – let the narrator read the content of the currently selected chapter
* Voice dictation – type with your voice
* Better pen support
* “Complex dialogues” – a dialogue with more features (can be easily exported, will support dialogue branching in near future)
* A proper Undo and Redo (in special cases maybe still a little bit buggy)

## **Notes**
I am learning as I work on this project, so the code is not perfect, but I will try to improve and improve the code with it.
