Storylines is a modern text editor for writing stories divided into chapters. 
Do you love writing stories? With Storylines and its powerful, yet simple and accessible tools, you can easily write anything you could ever think of. There are many options from just a plain text document to a quick draft of your story to an extensive multichapter story with dialogues between characters.
